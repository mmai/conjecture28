# A conjecture on the number 28

Some programs to explore a [little conjecture of mine](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/212985/intersection-between-the-sums-of-the-first-positive-integers-primes-and-non-primes) :

**The number 28 is the only number that can be written as a sum of the first n integers (1+2+3+4+5+6+7), m first primes (2+3+5+7+11) and p first non-primes (1+4+6+8+9).** 


I was not able to prove it (is it related to the Riemann hypothesis ?).

## Usage

```sh
runhaskell haskell/C28.hs
```
